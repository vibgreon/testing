Customers began to doubt the product‚Äôs authenticity and frequently questioned whether the items were second-hand or of inferior quality.</p><p>Additionally, confusion arose regarding whether the same product could be ordered for different competition categories, as each category followed distinct rules and featured different design styles.</p><p>To address these concerns, we implemented two key strategies:</p><ol><li><strong>Clarifying the Product Nature</strong><br>We introduced messaging such as <em>‚ÄúMade to Order‚Äù, ‚ÄúMade for You‚Äù,</em> and <em>‚ÄúBespoke Product‚Äù</em> to emphasize that each item is crafted only after an order is placed‚Äîreinforcing the idea of uniqueness and quality.</li><li><strong>Enhancing Product Transparency</strong><br>Many product pages lacked detailed descriptions, a missed opportunity in e-commerce to build trust. We filled this gap by adding relatable, informative content that not only conveyed the premium quality of the products but also clarified their availability across different competition categories, including options for customization.</li></ol><p>To further strengthen the perception of personalization, we designed a prominent <strong>‚ÄúMade for You‚Äù</strong> badge placed directly on or around the product images.

Eventually, the core value was in the architecture itself, which became the key offering during its mid-mature stage of exploration and implementation.",
