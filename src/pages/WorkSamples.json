However, the technology and user experience needed to support a non-technical user in adopting a digital system turned out to be more complex than expected. Fortunately, the company owner was already familiar with digital tools and had previously used several to manage their workflow. This made it clear that our primary focus should be on building a precise system to automate their current processes.</p><p>With that goal in mind, we started by breaking down the core functionalities and data flows. This approach helped ensure that the system could easily accommodate future changes. In fact, this proved valuable later when a request to add customer request handling was seamlessly integrated, even after the core functionalities had been designed and developed.</p><p>While optimizing the system structure, I gained a deeper understanding of the business operations and the motivation behind their decision to automate everything. This insight led me to propose a plan to scale the product, not immediately, but after the basic needs were fully addressed.</p><p>My key suggestions were:</p><ul><li><strong>Adopt a SaaS architecture:</strong> This would allow the product to be used by other business professionals in similar industries. It would help them optimize client handling and save time, while the company could gather feedback from a wider audience, build brand recognition as a reliable industry tool, and generate recurring revenue through subscriptions.</li><li><strong>Distribute insurance commission within the SaaS ecosystem:</strong> Currently, the company earns revenue through insurance commissions. By distributing commissions across the SaaS network, professionals using the platform could earn a share by selling insurance themselves. This would benefit the company by increasing sales while giving professionals a cut and offering their clients a wider range of options.</li><li><strong>Enable long-term partnership opportunities:</strong> A scalable product like this could unlock future collaborations and business partnerships that aren't yet visible, but could emerge as the product gains traction.</li></ul>",
